José Limón looked to    classic literature and religion  for his dance themes.  His  powerful dancers gave males  a more significant role. Choreographer  and  anthropologist Katherine  Dunham researched Caribbean  religious rituals and developed  a style of performance that    celebrated the African roots of  Black Americans. Bob Fosse borrowed    elements of tap dance, cabaret  performances, and acting to  create a signature style that  still influences dancers today.    All of these Innovative  Choreographers made their  own mark on the dance world. 4710 Aerial Views of Earth 4721 Emancipation Proclamation “Broadside” 4722-25 Digital Flower Drawings 2013 Commemoratives 4726 Year of the Snake The sheet pictured to the left was issued  to honor the 100th birth anniversary of  Lady Bird Johnson, who spearheaded the  movement to beautify US roadways.
